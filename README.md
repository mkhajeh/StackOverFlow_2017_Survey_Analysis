## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions "3.8.3".

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
As I am in the process of career change toward 'World of Data', I found analyzing and interpretation of data provided by stackOverflow so interesting.
In addition to taking several online courses from Udacity, Udemy and Couersera, I will be MSc student of Georgia Tech university (Data Science program) from January 2021 as well. But still there are several questions that I was curious about them and I though by analyzing stackOverflow survey, I can find answer for them. the main questions that I had in my mind was: How Salary could be predicted based on main feature of job itself and feature of candidate. How Career Satisfaction is correlated with the participant's expectation and etc. I tried to use data in 2017 StackoverFlow Survey to answer to these question.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
All the codes have been written in one ipynb file which is here in this repository. there are also two csv file which have been used as an input data set and could be found in this reposity as well.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

Some interesting results regarding career satisfaction found from this project. More specifically I was interested to have a quick comparison between Career satisfaction in US vs. all other countries. It sounds like that in general US employees are happier (but not so significant) with their career in comparison to the rest of the world. in addition I tried to predict Salary using linear regression model. Although I am happy with the KPI's which show accuracy of regression, but as all projects there are still lots of rooms for improvement.

## Acknowledgements <a name="Acknowledgements"></a>
Thanks to Udacity for defining this great project. Not only something directly related to coding and Data Science work flow, as a result of this project I learned other subjects such as git/GitHub and also how to write a post on Medium.
